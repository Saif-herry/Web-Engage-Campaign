#### Answer
Dear Account Manager
I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you of a family emergency that has arisen in my place and request you for project deadline extension.
Due to some unexpected situation, I was not able to complete the task on time. I understand that this may cause an inconvenience, and I apologize for the disruption cause. I would be grateful to you if you could grant me an extension of more than three days to complete the project as soon as possible.
I assure you that I will make every effort to catch up and complete the project to the best of my abilities. I appreciate your understanding and support during this challenging time.
Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your positive response.
